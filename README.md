This project aims to detect the likelihood of migraines using machine learning techniques. A Random Forest Classifier model is employed for its robustness and accuracy. The user interface is built with Streamlit, offering a simple and interactive experience for users to input symptoms and receive predictions.

Features:
   - User-Friendly Interface: Built with Streamlit for ease of use.
   - Machine Learning Model: Uses a Random Forest Classifier for accurate migraine predictions.
